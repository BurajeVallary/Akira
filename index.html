    <h2>My experience</h2>
    <p>A journey of a thousand miles begin with a single step and hail to the single step i have made believing that it will take me to the a thousand miles i desire.On 28th January was the beginning of a new era where i was to join the AkiraChix.We arrived in school at around 7am all joyful and happy ready to embark on my educational studies. It was like a dream come true after the ups and downs i had gone through. Upon arrival we the students were taken to their rooms and showed around as the parents assembled at the Kaya within the school compound. The AkiraChix community was welcoming in regardless of the counrty or county you are coming from. They were kind enough and were able to give us breakfast as we waited for the other parents to arrive. Later the meeting started and the parents were oriented and taken through the programs, upon agreement the signed the documents given.
        <P>The lectures started officially on Monday whereby we were taken through the course outline for the next ten months. It was intresting keeping in mind I have never interacted with computer from childhood to adulthood, for me it was like a dream come true and i was living my dream. Meeting with people from different part of the world and getting to know their culture and also making new friends. The environment here is serene making it easy for me to learn and it also feel likes a safe place as well.</P>
